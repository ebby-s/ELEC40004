Programming for Engineers Portfolio : Quarter 1, Set 1
======================================================

Remember that you need to solve these questions alone. Be aware that
different people may get slightly different questions, including
in ways that may not be obvious to you - make sure you are
solving your own problems.

1. Create an empty file called `e1-wibble.txt`.

2. Create an text file called `e2-es1219` containing the
    text `es1219`.

3. Create an empty directory called `e3-es1219`.

4. Delete the directory called `e4-delete-me`.

5. Run the command `lsb_release -a` and capture the output of
    the program into a file called `e5-output.txt` in this directory.

    (Hint: use the right arrow '>' to redirect output to a file.
    Note that not everything that appears on the screen is "output".)

6. Compile the source file `e6-program.cpp` into a binary called `e6-program`.

7. Run `e7-program`, and record the output in a file called `e7-output.txt`.

8. The source file `e8-error.cpp` contains a compile-time error. Fix the
    error, and save the fixed source file as `e8-fixed.cpp`.

9. The source file `e9-twice.cpp` reads an integer, doubles it, and writes
   it to output. Convert it so that it squares the number instead (but still
   has the same source-file name.)

10. This question is explicitly outside the plagiarism policy, and for this
    question only you are expected to collaborate and submit the same file.

    a. Find your personal tutor group (i.e. the small group of people
       you attend tutorial sessions with).

    b. Take a group selfie.

    c. Use the [imagemagick](https://imagemagick.org/) program
       to convert the photo to a `.pgm` image with pixel dimensions
       of `320x240`. (Hint: you want the `convert` program. Searching
       for `imagemagick jpg to pgm` may help)

    d. Name the file `groupie.pgm`

    Note that the `pgm` file format is not very useful; it is mainly to try
    to think of something that you're unlikely to be able to create in
    any other way.

You don't need to submit these till the end of reading week. For now
just keep a copy of them somewhere safe, and you'll add to them in 
future weeks.
