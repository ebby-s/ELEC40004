ELEC40004 Portfolio Q4
======================

This portfolio has been adapted due to the missed time
on the strikes, and also to try to make sure people are
prepared in a basic way for the remote working. While
the final exam was always intended to be distributed,
there will likely be more emphasis on remote collaboration
as many people won't be able to sit in the same room.

While this assessment is happening after the end of
term, the processes involved are extremely simple,
and are things that were covered in lab over this
quarter. They are also explicitly things that you will
need to be doing for revision/practise purposes for
the exam - either you know how to do it already and
it will take no time, or it is something you _must_
work out how to do before the exam.

So essentially these have ended up being free marks for
doing revision.

Remote repository
-----------------

Pre-requisite: your team needs to have been registered, either
due to manual selection, or through the random selection process.

Once your team is registered, you will receive access
to a repository `ELEC40004/elec40004-2019-q4-portfolio-LOGIN1-LOGIN2`,
where `LOGIN1` and `LOGIN2` are your Imperial logins, and
`LOGIN1` is the login that is the smaller login by lexicographic
ordering.

T1 - Perform a merge commit
---------------------------

Each team member should clone this repository (`ELEC40004/elec40004-2019-q4-portfolio-master`),
and then  create a file called `LOGIN.txt` (where `LOGIN` is your imperial login) in the
same directory as this readme. The file itself can be empty.
The commits should be made by two different users.

Both commits should then be commited and pushed/merged by
the two partners.

T2 - Create a remote feature branch
-----------------------------------

Each partner should create a file called `feature-LOGIN.txt`,
and commit it into a branch called `feature-LOGIN`. The commits
should be made by two different users. This should then be pushed
by each user to a remote branch called `feature-LOGIN` in your shared
repository.

T3 - Merge features back into master
------------------------------------

The two feature branches should be merged back into
master, and pushed to your shared repository. The
feature branches should be left in place.

T4 - Statement on communication method
--------------------------------------

Work out how you and your partner are going to communicate,
then move the `x` below to the appropriate selection:

- [ ] We don't have a planned communications method 
- [ ] Working together in person
- [x] WhatsApp
- [ ] WeChat
- [ ] Skype
- [ ] Slack
- [ ] Hangouts
- [ ] Microsoft Teams
- [ ] Email
- [ ] Github Issues
- [x] Phone Calls
- [ ] Other: __(Edit here)__

It is strongly suggested that you have at least two methods planned,
particularly if your primary method is bandwidth intensive.

Once you have moved the `x` to another check-box, one of you should
commit and push. 

T5 - Evidence of collaboration method
-------------------------------------

Create, commit, and push a file called `collaboration.*` which provides some
evidence that you have actually used the collaboration method. The most 
easiest method would be a screenshot such as `collaboration.png` or `collaboration.jpg`
showing the relevant web-site or app being used. Or you could include `collaboration.txt`
which simply states the date on which you phoned each other.

Pretty much anything is acceptable, as long as it provides some confidence
you have actually tried out the method you plan to use.

You can blur out or anonymise anything that is not relevant.

Only one user needs to commit this.

T6 - Submit a hash from master blackboard
-----------------------------------------

Take the current hash from master on github and submit it to blackboard.

Both partners should submit the same hash.

If you modify your repository later on, you should submit the new
hash.

Expected outputs
----------------

At the end of this, your shared repository should contain:

- A file called `LOGIN1.txt` created by one user
- A file called `LOGIN2.txt` created by another user
- A branch called `feature-LOGIN1` containing a file `feature-LOGIN1.txt`
- A branch called `feature-LOGIN2` containing a file `feature-LOGIN2.txt`
- The two branches merged into master
- A checked box describing the communication method you've planned
- A file called `collaboration.*` (e.g. `collaboration.jpg`, `collaboration.png`,
  `collaboration.txt`) which provides minimal evidence that you have tried
  out the collaboration method.
- A hash submitted to blackboard which matches the hash of your master
  repository in github.
