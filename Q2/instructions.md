Programming for Engineers Portfolio : Quarter 2
===============================================

These exercises follow the same format as before, with three sets of
exercises making up the quarter, and submission of the
output of `prepare_submission.sh` via blackboard.

The releases happen each Friday evening (Nov 22nd, Nov 29th, Dec 6th).
In the final week of term there will be no new exercises, and no
content from that week will be covered in this set.

### Sanity check : Mon 16th Dec at 9:00

On Monday 16th at 9:00 a copy of all the current submissions will be
grabbed, and some basic sanity checks will be run. The aim would
be to get some basic checks back by the afternoon of the same day,
to check whether files are in the right place with the right name,
and so on.

### Final deadline : Fri 20th at 22:00

The final submission deadline is on Friday 20th (one week after the end of term).

The deadline is shifted by cohort request.
